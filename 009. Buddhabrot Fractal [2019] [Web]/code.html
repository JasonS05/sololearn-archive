		<p>Ideally, there would be as high as 10000 or higher as the iteration limit, but that takes far too long, so I set it to only 100 which ends up producing this grey circle around the fractal and a low quality image. Additionally, the other parameter, called pointsPerPixel in the JavaScript code, should also be higher for a high quality image. Unfortunately, when I increase it the rendering slows so I put it at 100. You could change the ratio of these two numbers for different results as the overall time taken to render the image is approximately equal to the product of these two numbers so changing their ratio won't change the time taken by much as long as their product remains similar.</p>
	<p>I recommend checking out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot">wikipedia page</a> on the Buddhabrot for much better images of it.</p>
