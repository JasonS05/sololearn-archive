		<p>The compression ratio of this setup is 11:1, a normal value for gasoline engines (which range from 8:1 to 12:1). Assuming that when the piston is at the bottom the air pressure is at one atmosphere and at a temperature of 25 celsius (77 fahrenheit) and that the cylinder is sealed, then when the piston rises to the top compressing the air to 1/11th its former volume the air will be at a pressure of 28 atmospheres and a temperature of 500 degrees celsius (932 fahrenheit).</p>
