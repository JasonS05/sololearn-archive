			In this tutorial I will be going over how to use WebGL
			floating point textures. I will be assuming you already
			know how to use WebGL and WebGL textures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Floating point textures are just like ordinary textures,
			but instead of having a byte for each color channel
			holding an integer value in the range 0 - 255 (normalized
			to the range 0.0 - 1.0 from the shader's perspective), it
			holds a 32 bit floating point number in each color
			channel. This number is not normalized for the shaders
			meaning it can retrieve and store any number to and from
			the texture that can be represented by a 32 bit float. As
			you may imagine, this is incredibly valuable for programs
			that use WebGL to perform simulations involving large
			arrays of numbers. Being limited to not only the range
			0.0 - 1.0, but also only being able to use only 255
			distinct values in that range is crippling for many
			simulations, so floating point textures are incredibly
			valuable for this purpose. Unfortunately, when I tried
			to use them, I found that they simply refused to work and
			for a very long time I was unable to use them. Finally I
			eventually found what the problem was and I can now use
			them without issue. Because the solution was so simple,
			yet so non-obvious, I am making this tutorial. And also
			because SoloLearn user Mike Perkowski requested it.

			When a shader reads from a texture, the GPU can see how
			far apart the points are that the fragment shader is
			reading from. Basically, if you have a 100x100 texture,
			and you render it to a 50x50 region on the canvas, it can
			see that the the shader is reading the texture at 1/2
			scale. In order to improve the appearance of textures
			rendered at a size different from the size of the
			texture, it uses minification and magnification
			filters. By default, these are set to be linear
			filters. But there's a problem with that. Linear
			filtering isn't supported by default for float textures.
			And as a result, if you try to use floating point
			textures, it will fail mysteriously. Specifically, any
			read will return vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) regardless of
			the value actually stored within. This can be fixed in
			two ways. The first is to use the
			OES_texture_float_linear extension which isn't gaurenteed
			to be supported, so I prefer to avoid this if possible.
			The second option is to ditch linear filtering and
			manually specify nearest filtering. Really, it should
			just default to nearest for floating point textures if
			OES_texture_float_linear isn't enabled, but it doesn't,
			so we have to manually specify it. The code for that
			looks like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
let tex = gl.createTexture();
gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, tex);
gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA32F, 128, 128, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.FLOAT, null);
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.NEAREST);
gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, gl.NEAREST);</pre>
		<p>
			This creates a blank floating point texture with
			dimensions 128x128 and nearest filtering. Also, this
			assumes you are using WebGL2. If not, then you
			additionally need to include this code immediately
			after you create the WebGL context:
		</p>
		<pre>
let ext = gl.getExtension("OES_texture_float");
if (!ext) {
	console.log("OES_texture_float not supported");
}</pre>
	<p>
		And also replace gl.RGBA32F with gl.RGBA because WebGL1
		doesn't have gl.RGBA32F, so it instead just infers it based
		on your use of gl.FLOAT combined with gl.RGBA.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you additionally want to be able to render to floating
		point textures with a framebuffer, you need to enable the
		EXT_color_buffer_float extension for WebGL2, or the
		WEBGL_color_buffer_float extension for WebGL1. The code for
		WebGL2 thus looks like:
	</p>
		<pre>
let ext = gl.getExtension("EXT_color_buffer_float");
if (!ext) {
	console.log("EXT_color_buffer_float not supported");
}</pre>
	<p>
		And for WebGL1:
	</p>
	<pre>
let ext = gl.getExtension("OES_texture_float");
if (!ext) {
	console.log("OES_texture_float not supported");
}

ext = gl.getExtension("WEBGL_color_buffer_float");
if (!ext) {
	console.log("WEBGL_color_buffer_float not supported");
}</pre>
	</body>
