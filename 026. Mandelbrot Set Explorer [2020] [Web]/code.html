		<p>This image to the left is what's known as the Mandelbrot fractal. What the Mandelbrot fractal is is a bit hard to explain, so go check out the wikipedia page on it, and if you can't understand it (wikipedia likes using big fancy words and equations) go check out the numberphile video on it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk">here</a>. It's what helped me understand what this fractal is and how to compute it. Also, make sure to check out a few of the many "Mandelbrot Zooms" on youtube. They're really pretty!</p>
		<p>My to-do list for this Mandelbrot project:</p>
			<li>Looks like nothing's here! Make some suggestions in the comments section and I may add it to this list.</li>
