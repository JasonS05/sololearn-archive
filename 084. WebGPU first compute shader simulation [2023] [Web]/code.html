<!--
    This uses a very simple compute shader that just makes three
    particles move exponentially away from the center. The shader
    runs thirty times with a twentieth of a second between each
    invocation. The shader simply multiplies the coordinates of
    the particles by 1.1. The vertex shader then reads the data
    for the coordinates of the particles and arranges the vertices
    of the triangles accordingly to show the locations of the
    particles. The fragment shader simply colors the pixels
    according to the color given by the vertex shader, which is
    hardcoded to red.
