		<p>The result of 2 + 4 as computed by my custom WASM module is <span id="test">[Uh oh looks like something went wrong]</span></p>
		<p>Also, my WASM module logged to the console the sum of 3 and 4 (assuming nothing went wrong).</p>
		<p>To find out more about the interesting inner workings of this, I suggest you head to the JS tab of this code.</p>
		<p>Also, if this code doesn't work, then please give me the error that appears in the console.</p>
