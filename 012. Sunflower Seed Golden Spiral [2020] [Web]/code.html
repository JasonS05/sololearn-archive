		<p>This is a golden spiral. To make the image above you start at the center and place a dot. You then turn around a number of revolutions equal to the golden ratio (~1.618) and then place another dot, but a little bit in front of you. You then repeat but keep placing the dot a little farther each time so they don't get all crowded in the middle. This creates a golden spiral, and this is in fact the same pattern sunflower seeds in a sunflower make. There are few other numbers with this property of making such a nice pattern. Try adding 0.001 to the value of the golden ratio in the code and see a totally different pattern that doesn't fill a circle nearly as nicely. In a search for other numbers to do the job, I found that pi worked no better than some random integer, but the silver ratio (1 + sqrt(2)) produces a pattern nearly identical to that of the golden ratio. If you know of any other numbers with this seemingly rare property please put them in the comments.</p>
