		<p>This is a simulation of gravitationally attracted bodies in motion relative to each other. You can use the buttons to select which configuration you want to see. With this simulation you can see how these bodies orbit and interact. On the left is how it would look to a distant observer, and on the right is with the "camera" translated to always keep the sun in the center and rotated to always keep the Earth at the bottom.</p>
		<p>This simulation isn't super incredibly consistent, so every time you run this simulation the result will change and become more different the longer it runs until it's totally different from the last time it was run. For example, in one run, the moon could be ejected from the system fairly quickly and then shortly after mars gets ejected and Earth is left in a highly elliptic orbit, and in another run they could stay around much longer interacting for a long time producing interesting results until one or more bodies are ejected from the system.
