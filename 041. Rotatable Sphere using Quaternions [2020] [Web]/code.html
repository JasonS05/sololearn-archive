		<p>The above is a sphere that you can drag with your finger to rotate (mouse support coming <s>soon</s> never). Each point on the sphere is independant from the rest. In fact, there is no sphere, just a collection of independant points. The coordinates of each point are represented by quaternions, and when you drag your finger across the sphere, every points' coordinates get multiplied by the a certain quaternion (and the same one for every point) causing them to rotate around the around the same axis by the same number of degrees. This is the power of quaternions.</p>
