	This is a Molecular Dynamics simulaton. This means that it
	simulates the behavior of substances on an atomic level.
	This particular simulation uses an atomic model called the
	Lennard Jones potential. This is a very simple description
	of interatomic forces that essentially says that at long
	distances atoms do not interact, at moderate distances atoms
	attract, and at short distances atoms very strongly repel.

	This potential is able to simulate a wide variety of
	phenomena. In particular, it is capable of simulating solids,
	liquids, gasses, and supercritical fluids with a high degree
	of physical accuracy. However, because the potential is so
	simple, it is only an accurate description of noble gasses.
	Noble gasses interact almost exclusively through the Van der
	Waals force. The Lennard Jones potential was designed
	specifically to be an approximation of the Van der Waals
	force.

	In this simulation, the atoms start out on a square grid
	spaced approximately at their preffered interatomic spacing.
	However, these atoms do not naturally form a square grid.
	Their preferred crystal structure is hexagonal. Consequently
	they fairly rapidly rearrange into a hexagonal lattice,
	releasing heat in the process. Heat is a vibration of the
	atoms. If your monitor has enough resolution to clearly see
	the positions of the atoms (my 1920x1080 monitor doesn't)
	you will see them vibrating back and forth chaotically in
	their positions in the crystal lattice.

	Another feature you will notice is crystal grains. The
	lattice has an associated orientiation. Each section of the
	lattice forms with a somewhat random orientation. This
	causes the lattice to form what are called grains, which
	are regions of the lattice with the same orientation. Being
	split into grains like this is thermodynamically
	unfavorable. As such, with the help of the random thermal
	oscillations, the grain boundaries move about and some
	grains shrink and disappear while others grow. Eventually,
	there will only be a few large grains left which will take
	a very long time to merge, likely far longer than anyone
	has the patience for.
