		<p>To the left is an image of the Ulam spiral. What is the Ulam spiral, you ask? Well, imagine a spiral like this
		<code><br/>
5 - 4 - 3   etc.
|   .   |   |
6   1 - 2   11
|   .   .   |
7 - 8 - 9 - 10
(ignore the periods; they prevent the white-space from automatically collapsing into tabs)
		</code><br/>Each number within the spiral is colored white if it's composite and black if it's prime. When you make each number's corresponding pixel that number's color, you get an image known as the Ulam spiral. Notice how in the spiral there are lines with more primes than others, and some lines with virtually no primes! Very interesting, if you ask me. If you like primes, make sure to check out the wikipedia page on the Ulam spiral!</p>
