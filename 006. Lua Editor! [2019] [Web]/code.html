		<p>This can run Lua programs. All you have to do is write your program in the box above and press the &#8220RUN&#8221 button to run it. The standard <code>print</code> function as defined by the script that runs the Lua writes to the javascript console, so I had to redefine it. There was also no <code>io.write</code> function. In fact, there was no <code>io</code> library at all! So I had to define <code>io</code> to be a table with the <code>write</code> function as its only element so you could use <code>io.write</code>.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220FIX SPECIAL CHARACTERS&#8221 turns smart quotes (&#8216quote&#8217 &#8220quote&#8221) into regular quotes ('quote' "quote") and dashes (&#8212) into double hyphens (--) and bullets (&#8226) into asterisks (*).</p>
		
		<p>Feel free to copy this code but with <code>print("Hello, World!")</code> replaced with your program to post Lua programs. Just make sure to give me credit!</p>
		
		<p>My to-do list:
			<ul>
				<li>Auto-indent</li>
				<li><code>io.read</code></li>
			</ul>
